# coding90

Coding study records for internship and main selection process..

List of "Atcoder" problems : https://atcoder.jp/contests/typical90/tasks

The goal is to solve 6 problems a day for a total of 15 days from April 16 to April 30.

I really want to start working on my next iOS app instead of preparing for the coding exam.

However, I want to do my best to prepare for the coding exam because it is also a good way to learn algorithms.
